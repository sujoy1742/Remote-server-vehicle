# Remote server vehicle
 Remote server to control robotic vehicles

## How to Access

You can download the entire project directory and run the scr appplication directly to connect to the local server and gain access to your robot.

## About

One of the major difficulties faced today by Ecommerce and other large scale industries are the limitations bimposed by limited distance communication capacity. Modern day robotic vehicles primarily rely on data transmission capability of the chosen network. Therefore, there is a need of a communication paradigm that enables manual control of industrial mobile robots with unlimited range of operation.

### The Tool

The tool connects a remote 4 wheeled robot to the main server and transmits video feed using Http protocol.
